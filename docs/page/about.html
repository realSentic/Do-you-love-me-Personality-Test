      <h2>About SPT</h2>
      <h4>(Sentic Personality Tests)</h4>
      <p>Hey! Welcome to SPT, which stands for Sentic Personality Tests. I made this website because I’ve always been interested in personality tests, and I also love coding. So I thought, why not combine the two? It’s a fun way for me to practice coding while sharing something entertaining and insightful with others.</p>
      <br>
      <p>SPT is all about taking simple, playful quizzes that give you results based on your choices. After you finish a test, you’ll see a little description that explains what your answers say about your personality. The goal isn’t to be serious or “right” or “wrong," it’s just a fun way to reflect on yourself a bit and enjoy the process.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Thanks for checking out SPT! Dive into a test, see what your results say about you, and most importantly… have fun.</p>
